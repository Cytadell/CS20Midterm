            <div>
                <h2>Affordable</h2>
                <p>We commit to making sure our properties are never inaccessible because of price. No Tufts student will be unable to rent from us due to money, as we have partnered with Tufts to provide subsidized housing for all who qualify. Our Off-Campus Housing Affordability Program is easy to sign up for, and covers up to $1,000 per month of rent for its members! No strings attached!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Responsible</h2>
                <p>We commit to ensuring quick responses and next-day maintenance for all of our properties and tenants. All of us have had too many landlords ignore emails, ignore damage, and only show up to collect rent checks. We check our emails on the hour so we never miss a communication from our tenants, and our trusty team of repairmen are always on call to fix any issue our properties might have, rain or shine.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Incredible</h2>
                <p>We commit to giving each and every one of our tenants the best rental experience we can. We are no average rental company. Year after year, Tufts students have found our properties and services to be of the highest caliber, rivaled by none in the Medford area.  We encourage you to come find out why, and are eager to welcome you to the *COMPANY NAME HERE* experience! See you soon!</p>
